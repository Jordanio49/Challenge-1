# Code Refactor Starter Code

## **Description**

This project asked that I focus on two things.
1. I added scemantic language to an HTML file for the Horiseon website.
2. I adjusted the CSS stylesheet to reflect the changes I made, and I simplified it by combining some of the code that was repeated.
